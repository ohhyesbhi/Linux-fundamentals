# REPEL 
(READ EVALUATE PRINT LOOP) -: It is kind of like a infinite loop where in every iteration of a loop it reads a valid command from the user for example if we are trying to run a python console then it will read the valid python command from you , if you are just running the terminal that means it is going to expect a valid shell script command from you.It is going to evaluate that command is what actually going to do and then whatever is the result of that command after execution of the command then it will print the result of that command and then it loops again , whuch actually means it again expects you to write something so these type of console are actually called as repel consoles or repel shells.
